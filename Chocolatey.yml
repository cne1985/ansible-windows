Local path to a file to copy to the remote server; can be absolute or relative.,If path is a directory, it is copied (including the source folder name) recursively to C(dest).,If path is a directory and ends with "/", only the inside contents of that directory are copied to the destination. Otherwise, if it does not end with "/", the directory itself with all contents is copied.,If path is a file and dest ends with "\", the file is copied to the folder with the same filename.
        dest: C:\AnsibleUpdateLog\UpdateLog.txt # required. Remote absolute path where the file should be copied to. If src is a directory, this must be a directory too.,Use \ for path separators or \ when in "double quotes".,If C(dest) ends with \ then source or the contents of source will be copied to the directory without renaming.,If C(dest) is a nonexistent path, it will only be created if C(dest) ends with "/" or "\", or C(src) is a directory.,If C(src) and C(dest) are files and if the parent directory of C(dest) doesn't exist, then the task will fail.
